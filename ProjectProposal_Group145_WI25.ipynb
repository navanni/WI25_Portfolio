    "Investment strategies that rely heavily on price predictions often face significant challenges due to market volatility and the unpredictable nature of financial market and data. To address these challenges, machine learning models are increasingly being used not only to predict but also analyse real-time data such as market trends, risk exposure, and sentiment shifts to offer investors actionable guidance tailored to their risk profiles. \n",
    "A recent study by Timmermann et al. (2023) introduced a Fund Confidence Set (FCS) approach, in their paper “Picking Funds with Confidence.” They identify high-performing mutual funds through a series of pairwise performance comparisons. This method avoids direct predictions of future returns and instead focuses on eliminating underperforming funds based on real-time risk-adjusted metrics. By continuously adapting to changing economic conditions, the model ensures that selected funds remain relevant and competitive. This dynamic approach highlights the importance of \"evolving market states and risk conditions in shaping fund performance\" (Timmermann 6)​.\n",
    "Additionally, machine learning research has demonstrated the value of integrating technical and sentiment analysis for decision-making in financial markets. In a study on stock market analysis, in the paper “Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning”, Parmar et al. (2018) describe how regression and LSTM models are traditionally used for prediction. However, they emphasize that the foundation of any reliable model lies in understanding historical market variables such as trading volume and price fluctuations without solely depending on forecasting (Parmar, p. 3). The study underlines that maintaining data integrity and focusing on diverse indicators like volatility and news sentiment can improve the model's ability to provide timely investment insights.\n",
    "Building on these findings, our project aims to create a decision-support system that analyzes market data to generate investment recommendations. By leveraging both risk-adjusted performance models and real-time data streams, our system would adapt to users’ risk tolerance and portfolio needs. We would like to emphasize the dynamic data integration to guide decision-making without speculating on exact future price levels. This framework seeks to improve investor confidence and stability in uncertain market environments. \n",

    "## **Are there any biases/privacy/terms of use issues with the data you proposed?**  \n",
    "Financial datasets often contain historical biases, such as overrepresentation of certain sectors or market conditions that may not generalize well to future predictions. This could lead to recommendations that unfairly favor specific industries or companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment scores from news and social media may be influenced by misinformation, biased reporting, or exaggerated public reactions, leading to skewed analysis. Additionally, models used in financial predictions tend to be somewhat of **“black boxes”** since companies developing them prioritize intellectual property protection. This opacity reduces trust in the system and limits accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also ethical concerns when models do not allow for transparency in decision-making. If biases exist in the dataset, they could negatively impact companies or industries by leading to incorrect or skewed recommendations. To mitigate such effects, there must be **regular updates, monitoring, and model adjustments** to ensure fairness and accuracy.\n",

    "Most financial market data is publicly available, but certain **investor behavior data** (e.g., trade logs, institutional fund movements) may have **privacy concerns**, especially if sourced from individual accounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis using data from platforms like **Twitter and Reddit** raises privacy issues since it involves analyzing individual user-generated content. These platforms may also **amplify extreme opinions** rather than providing a balanced view of market sentiment. Additionally, the **underrepresentation of minority-owned firms or smaller businesses** in market indices like the S&P 500 could introduce bias in analysis, disproportionately focusing on large-cap stocks.\n",

    "- **How will you set out to detect these specific biases before, during, and after/when communicating your analysis?**  \n",
    "1. **Before Analysis:** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to **identify sector overrepresentation, missing data patterns, and biases** in the dataset. Use statistical tests to assess bias in financial metrics across industries and company sizes.\n",
    "2.   **During Analysis:** Apply fairness-aware machine learning techniques, such as re-weighting underrepresented data points, debiasing sentiment analysis models (e.g., adjusting for extreme opinions), and running sensitivity analysis to test model robustness.\n",
    "3. **After Analysis:** Communicate uncertainty in findings, use **explainable AI (XAI) techniques** to increase transparency, and regularly audit predictions against real-world market performance. We will also **monitor model impact** to ensure it does not inadvertently contribute to market distortions, similar to the **Quant Meltdown of 2007**, where over-reliance on quantitative models led to significant financial losses.\n",

    "2. **Market Manipulation Risks:** If the model's investment recommendations gain widespread adoption, they could impact stock movements, leading to artificial demand or market distortions.\n",
