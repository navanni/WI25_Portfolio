# ESG Risk and S&P 500 Performance Analysis

**Course:** COGS 108—Winter 2025

This project was completed as part of a team assignment (5 members)

## Project Overview
The project looks at the relationship between **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) risk scores** and the **risk-adjusted performance of S&P 500 companies** during periods of market volatility. We asked "How does the risk-adjusted stock performance (measured by Sharpe Ratio) of S&P 500 companies with top-quartile ESG risk scores compare to those with bottom-quartile scores across sectors during periods of market volatility (measured by Volatility Index, VIX)?"

Our goal was to identify sectors most affected by ESG risk and quantify the effects

## Key Features & Workflow
**Data Collection & Cleaning**
Sourced ESG and financial datasets, handled missing values, and standardized data for analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Examined correlations, distributions, and sector-wise trends using correlation matrices, histograms, and summary statistics; checked assumptions were met for statistical models

**Time Series Conversion**
Aligned financial data with market volatility (VIX) to analyze performance over time

**Sector Analysis**
Identified and further analyzed the top three sectors most affected by ESG scores

**Key Insights & Takeaways/Conclusions**
Highlighted sectors where ESG risk most influence risk-adjusted performance

## Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scipy
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
