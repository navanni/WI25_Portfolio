    "# ESG Factors and Financial Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research highlights the growing impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on firm performance. Khan, Serafeim, and Yoon (2016) found that firms with high sustainability scores tend to exhibit superior risk-adjusted returns, particularly when ESG factors are material to the industry. Their study provides evidence that ESG-conscious companies may have a competitive advantage, but it does not specifically address performance in high-volatility market environments. Similarly, Albuquerque, Koskinen, and Zhang (2020) argue that firms with strong ESG commitments experience lower systematic risk and tend to perform better during downturns. Aydoğmuş et al (2022) concludes that ESG performance (especially the social and governance aspects) has a significant, positive relationship with profitability and firm value. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it did not find a significant relationship with the environmental aspect, they suggested that environmental actions may take longer to affect profitability because of slower progress and higher costs. These findings suggest that companies with strong environmental risk management might be more resilient during volatile market conditions, aligning with our research focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ESG Performance and Market Volatility (VIX > 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other studies explore the relationship between ESG factors and market turbulence. Engle, Giglio, Kelly, Lee, and Stroebel (2020) demonstrated that climate-conscious firms are less exposed to downside risk, suggesting that ESG factors could serve as a hedge against market volatility. Meanwhile, Brière, Peillex, and Ureche-Rangau (2019) analyzed whether socially responsible investing (SRI) funds outperform during turbulent market conditions. Their results indicate that high-ESG funds tend to be more resilient but may underperform in certain volatility regimes, raising the question of whether environmental risk scores specifically influence risk-adjusted returns during extreme volatility periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these studies provide insights into ESG and volatility, they do not directly measure the interaction between environmental risk scores and stock performance under extreme volatility (VIX > 30), which is the central focus of our research.\n",

    "# Machine Learning, Real-Time Data, and Decision-Support Systems in Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond ESG factors, research has increasingly explored how machine learning and real-time data can enhance investment strategies. Feng, He, and Polson (2018) highlight how deep learning models can improve asset pricing and market forecasting by adapting to evolving data streams. Timmermann et al. (2023) introduced the Fund Confidence Set (FCS) approach, which identifies high-performing mutual funds by continuously eliminating underperforming ones using real-time risk-adjusted performance metrics rather than predicting future returns. Additionally, Parmar et al. (2018) emphasize that machine learning models work best when they integrate technical and sentiment analysis rather than relying purely on price forecasts. \n",

    "# How Our Work is Different\n",
    "\n",
    "While prior research has explored ESG investing, risk-adjusted returns, and machine learning-based investment strategies, our work integrates these elements in a novel way by analyzing the interaction between environmental risk scores and market volatility to develop an adaptive decision-support system. Unlike studies that examine ESG factors in isolation (Khan et al., 2016; Albuquerque et al., 2020) or those that explore real-time fund selection without considering ESG (Timmermann et al., 2023), our research explicitly investigates how environmental risk scores influence risk-adjusted stock performance (Sharpe ratio) when market volatility (VIX) exceeds 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we emphasize the dynamic integration of real-time data streams into investment decision-making, moving beyond static ESG scoring models. Our framework will leverage machine learning techniques to provide investors with risk-adjusted investment insights that evolve in response to changing market conditions rather than relying on traditional forecasting methods. By doing so, we aim to enhance investor confidence and stability in uncertain market environments, bridging the gap between ESG-focused investing and adaptive portfolio management.\n",

    "**SP 500 ESG Risk Ratings** is a dataset with each of the S&P 500 companies and their corresponding Environment Risk Score. Environment Risk Score is a numerical rating from 0-100 that indicates how much a company or its activities harm the environment—a higher score corresponds to a greater risk of negative impact while a lower score indicates better environmental practices, taking factors like water usage and disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity impact, and compliance with environmental regulations into account. The dataset includes a lot of other information that we do not need, so there are only two columns that we care about for this project, ‘Name’ (of the company) and ‘Environment Risk Score. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The CBOE VIX dataset** is using the Chicago Board Option Exchange for the Volatility Index, which is a measure of implied volatility and reflects how much investors anticipate the market to fluctuate in the near future (next ~30 days). Generally, a VIX value of over 30 is linked to a larger volatility and therefore increased uncertainty, investors’ fear, and risk while values below 20 correspond to more stable periods in the market. VIX is impacted by a variety of factors, including geopolitical events, market dynamics, and economic indicators (like GDP, inflation, interest rates, consumer spending, etc) as well as investor sentiment (eg positive market news can reduce fear, lowering the VIX), trading volumes, and option prices. The dataset shows what the VIX was at the close of each month from May 2020 to May 2023 (we will disregard the other columns besides ‘Date’ and ‘Close’). \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Sharpe Ratio dataset** shows the measure of the risk-adjusted return of an investment and helps to understand how well the return of an asset compensates for the risk taken. It is calculated with a formula that takes into account the average return of the investment, the risk-free rate (based on 3-Month Treasury Bill), and the standard deviation of the investment’s return. A high Sharpe Ratio (>1) would mean that the investment is providing a better return for the level of risk taken, which is generally preferred. A low Sharpe Ratio  (<1, or negative) means that the returns do not justify the level of risk and that the investment may not be a good choice. This is a useful way to compare different investments with varying levels of risk and return and allow investors to have more information when making decisions.\n",
